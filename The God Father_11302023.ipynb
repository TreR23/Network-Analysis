      "he was a megalomaniac who loved to wield power wildly without  regard to the fact that \n",
      "by so doing legions of enemie s sprang up out of the ground. \n",
      "Hagen sighed. There would be no  way to “handle” Jack Woltz. He opened his briefcase \n",
      "and tried to get some paper work  done, but he was too tired. He ordered another martini \n",

      "hint to Woltz that if Hagen was not made happy by the result s of the interview, there \n",

      "“If it comes to that he’ll talk to you,” Hagen said. By saying this he avoided making any \n",

      "family empire, technically, did not extend beyond the New York area but Don Corleone \n",
      "had first become strong by helping labor leader s. Many of them still owed him debts of \n",
      "friendship. \n",
      "But the ten A.M. appointment was a bad sign. It meant that  he would be first on the \n",
      "appointment list, that he would not be invited to lunch. It meant that Woltz held him in \n",
      "small worth. Goff had not been threatening enough, probably because Woltz had him on \n",
      "his graft payroll. And sometimes the Don’ s success in keeping himself out of the \n",
      "limelight worked to the disadv antage of the family business,  in that his name did not \n",
      "mean anything to outside circles. \n",
      "His analysis proved correct. Woltz kept him waiting for a half hour past the appointed \n",
      "time. Hagen didn’t mind. The reception room wa s very plush, very comfortable, and on a \n",
      "plum-colored couch opposite him sat the most  beautiful child Hagen had ever seen. She \n",
      "was no more than eleven or twelve, dressed in  a very expensive but simple way as a \n",

      "and returned to their home towns. \n",
      "Jack Woltz was a tall, powerfully built man with a heavy paunch almost concealed by his perfectly tailored suit. Hagen knew his hist ory. At ten years of age Woltz had hustled \n",
      "empty beer kegs and pushcarts on the East Si de. At twenty he helped his father sweat \n",
      "garment workers. At thirty he had left Ne w York and moved West, invested in the \n",

      "paintings, was a member of the President ’s Advisory Committee, and had set up a \n",
      "multimillion-dollar foundation in  his name to promote art in  motion pictures. His daughter \n",
      "had married an English lord, his son an Italian princess. \n",
      "His latest passion, as reported dutifully by every movie columnist in America, was his \n",

      "the ministrations of the most  knowledgeable technicians, his age showed; the flesh of \n",
      "his face looked as if it had been seamed toget her. But there was an enormous vitality in \n",
      "his movements and he had what Don Corle one had, the air of a man who commanded \n",
      "absolutely the world in which he lived. \n",
      "Hagen came directly to the point. That he wa s an emissary from a friend of Johnny \n",
      "Fontane. That this friend was a very power ful man who would pledge his gratitude and \n",
      "undying friendship to Mr. Woltz if Mr. Woltz would grant a small favor. The small favor would be the casting of Johnny Fontane in the new war movie the studio planned to \n",
      "start next week. \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      " 44\n",
      "asked. There was just a trace of condescension in his voice. \n",
      "Hagen ignored the condescension. He expl ained. “You’ve got some labor trouble \n",

      "get any more heroin. And if some other littl e things come up over the years a phone call \n",
      "to me can solve your problems.” \n",
      "Jack Woltz listened to this as if he were hearing the boasting of a child. Then he said \n",
      "harshly, his voice deliberately all East Side, “You trying to put muscle on me?” \n",
      "Hagen said coolly, “Absolutely no t. I’ve come to ask a service for a friend. I’ve tried to \n",
      "explain that you won’t lose anything by it.” \n",
      "Almost as if he willed it, Woltz made his face a mask of anger. The mouth curled, his \n",
      "heavy brows, dyed black, contracted to form a thick line over his glinting eyes. He \n",
      "leaned over the desk toward Hagen. “All right, y ou smooth son of a bitch,  let me lay it on \n",
      "the line for you and your boss,  whoever he is. Johnny Font ane never gets that movie. I \n",
      "don’t care how many guinea Mafia goombahs co me out of the woodwork.” He leaned \n",
      "back. “A word of advice to you, my friend. J. Edgar Hoover, I assume you’ve heard of him”– Woltz smiled sardonically– “is a personal friend of mine. If I let him know I’m being \n",
      "pressured, you guys will never  know what hit you.” \n",
      "Hagen listened patiently. He  had expected better from a man of Woltz’s stature. Was it \n",
      "possible that a man who acted this stupidly could rise to the head of a company worth \n",
      "hundreds of millions? That was something to think about since the Don was looking for \n",
      "new things to put money into, and if the top br ains of this industry were so dumb, movies \n",
      "might be the thing. The abuse itself bothered him not at all. Hagen had  learned the art of \n",
      "negotiation from the Don himself. “Never get  angry,” the Don had instructed. “Never \n",
      "make a threat. Reason with people.” The word “reason” sounded so much better in \n",
      "Italian, ragione, to rejoin. The art of this was to  ignore all insults, all threats; to turn the \n",
      "other cheek. Hagen had seen the Don sit at  a negotiating table for eight hours, \n",
      "swallowing insults, trying to persuade a notorious and m egalomaniac strong-arm man to \n",
      "mend his ways. At the end of the eight hours  Don Corleone had thrown up his hands in \n",
      "a helpless gesture and said to the other m en at the table, “But  no one can reason with \n",
      "this fellow,” and had stalk ed out of the meeting room. The strong-arm man had turned \n",
      "white with fear. Emissaries were sent to  bring the Don back into the room. An   “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \n",

      " \n",
      " 45\n",
      "agreement was reached but two months later the strong-arm was shot to death in his \n",
      "favorite barbershop. \n",
      "So Hagen started again,  speaking in the most  ordinary voice. “Look at my card,” he \n",
      "said. “I’m a lawyer. Would I stick my neck ou t? Have I uttered one threatening word? Let \n",
      "me just say that I am prepared to meet any condition you name to get Johnny Fontane \n",
      "that movie. I think I’ve already offered a great  deal for such a small favor. A favor that I \n",
      "understand it would be in  your interest to grant. Johnny tells me that you admit he would \n",
      "be perfect for that part. And let me say that this favor would never be asked if that were \n",
      "not so. In fact, if you’re worried about your  investment, my client would finance the \n",
      "picture. But please let me make myself absolutely clear. We under stand your no is no. \n",
      "Nobody can force you or is trying to. We kn ow about your friendship with Mr. Hoover, I \n",
      "may add, and my boss respects you for it. He  respects that relationship very much.” \n",
      "Woltz had been doodling with a huge,  red-feathered pen. At t he mention of money his \n",
      "interest was aroused and he sto pped doodling. He said patronizingly, “This picture is \n",
      "budgeted at five million.” \n",
      "Hagen whistled softly to show that he was im pressed. Then he said very casually, “My \n",
      "boss has a lot of friends who back his judgment.” \n",
      "For the first time Woltz seemed to take t he whole thing seriously. He studied Hagen’s \n",
      "card. “I never heard of you,” he said. “I know  most of the big lawyers in New York, but \n",
      "just who the hell are you?” \n",
      "“I have one of those di gnified corporate practices,” Hagen said dryly. “I just handle this \n",
      "one account.” He rose. “I won’t take up any more of your time.” He held out his hand, \n",
      "Woltz shook it. Hagen took a few steps toward  the door and turned to  face Woltz again. \n",
      "“I understand you have to deal with a lot of people who try to seem more important than \n",
      "they are. In my case the reverse is true.  Why don’t you check me out with our mutual \n",
      "friend? If you reconsider, call me at my ho tel.” He paused. “This may be sacrilege to \n",
      "you, but my client can do things for you that even Mr. Hoover might find out of his \n",
      "range.” He saw the movie pro ducer’s eyes narrowing. Woltz was finally getting the \n",
      "message. “By the way, I admire your pictures very much,” Hagen said in the most \n",
      "fawning voice he could manage. “I hope you can keep up the good work. Our country \n",
      "needs it.” \n",
      "Late that afternoon Hagen received a call from the producer’s secretary that a car would \n",
      "pick him up within the hour to  take him out to Mr. Woltz’s country home for dinner. She   “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      " 46\n",
      "told him it would be about a three-hour drive but that the car was equipped with a bar \n",
      "and some hors d’oeuvres. Hagen knew that Wo ltz made the trip in his private plane and \n",
      "wondered why he hadn’t bee n invited to make the trip by air. The secretary’s voice was \n",
      "adding politely, “Mr. Woltz suggested you bring an overnight  bag and he’ll get you to the \n",
      "airport in the morning.” \n",
      "“I’ll do that,” Hagen said. That was another thing to wonder about. How did Woltz know \n",
      "he was taking the morning pla ne back to New York? He thought  about it for a moment. \n",
      "The most likely explanation was that Woltz had set private detectives on his trail to get \n",
      "all possible information. Then Woltz certai nly knew he represented the Don, which \n",
      "meant that he knew somethi ng about the Don, which in turn meant that he was now \n",
      "ready to take the whole matter seriously. Something might be done after all, Hagen \n",
      "thought. And maybe Woltz was smarter than he had appeared this morning. \n",
      "* * *  \n",
      "The home of Jack Woltz looked like an implausible movie set. There was a \n",
      "plantation-type mansion, huge grounds girdled by  a rich black-dirt bridle path, stables \n",
      "and pasture for a herd of horses. The hedges , flower beds and grasses were as \n",
      "carefully manicured as a movie star’s nails. \n",
      "Woltz greeted Hagen on a glass-paneled air-conditioned porch. The producer was \n",
      "informally dressed in blue silk  shirt open at the neck, mu stard-colored slacks, soft \n",
      "leather sandals. Framed in al l this color and rich fabric his seamed, tough face was \n",
      "startling. He handed H agen an outsized martini glass and t ook one for himself from the \n",
      "prepared tray. He seemed more friendly than he had been earlier in the day. He put his \n",
      "arm over Hagen’s shoulder and said, “We have a li ttle time before dinner, let’s go look at \n",
      "my horses.” As they walked toward the stables he said, “I checked you out, Tom; you \n",
      "should have told me your boss is Corleone. I thought you were just some third-rate \n",
      "hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. And I don’t bluff. Not that I want to make \n",
      "enemies, I never believed in that. But let’s just enjoy ourselves now. We can talk \n",
      "business after dinner.” \n",
      "Surprisingly Woltz proved to be a truly considerate host. He explained his new methods, innovations that he hoped woul d make his stable the most successful in America. The \n",
      "stables were all fire-proofed, sanitized to the highest degree, and guarded by a special \n",
      "security detail of private detectives. Finally  Woltz led him to a stall which had a huge \n",

      "forehead. The great brown eyes glinted like golden apples, th e black skin over the taut \n",

      "But, on the other hand, Sollozzo would want Clemenza in his pocket more than any \n",

      "like everybody else. Also he would have wilder  dreams of power, as the young always \n",

      "Paulie had been in the same class in school and he didn’t want it to be Paulie either. \n",
      "He shook his head. “Neither one of them,” he said. But he said it only because Sonny \n",

      "“If they had gotten the old man, what would you have done?” Michael asked. \n",

      "Of course, strictly speaking, this was not ne cessary. Paulie Gatto could be killed without \n",

      "set of heavy stuffed sofa and stuffed armchai rs, all covered with rich gold-threaded \n",
      "fabric. Nazorine and his fianc ee had spent a happy day pi cking out what they wanted \n",
      "from the huge warehouse crowded with furniture. The whol esaler took their money, their \n",
      "three hundred dollars wrung from  the sweat of their blood, and pocketed it and promised \n",
      "the furniture to be delivered within the week to the already rented flat. \n",
      "The very next week however, the firm had gone into bankruptcy. The great warehouse \n",
      "stocked with furniture had been sealed shut and attached for payment of creditors. The \n",
      "wholesaler had disappeared to gi ve other creditors time to unleash their anger on the \n",

      "Vito Corleone listened to this story with am used disbelief. It was not possible that the \n",
      "law could allow such thievery. The wholesal er owned his own palatia l home, an estate in \n",
      "Long Island, a luxurious automobile, and was seeding his children to college. How could \n",
      "he keep the three hundred doll ars of the poor baker Nazorine and not give him the \n",
      "furniture he had paid for? But, to make  sure, Vito Corleone had Genco Abbandando \n",
      "check it out with the lawyers who represented the Genco Pura company. \n",
      "They verified the story of Na zorine. The wholesaler had al l his personal wealth in his \n",

      "True, he had shown bad faith by  taking the money of Nazo rine when he knew he was \n",
      "going to file bankruptcy but this was a common practice. Under law there was nothing to \n",

      "Of course the matter was easily adjusted. Don Corleone sent his Consigliere, Genco \n",
      "Abbandando, to speak to the wholesaler, a nd as was to be expected, that wide-awake \n",
      "businessman caught the drift immediately and a rranged for Nazorine to get his furniture. \n",
      "But it was an interesting lesson for the young Vito Corleone. \n",
      "The second incident had more far-reaching  repercussions. In 19 39, Don Corleone had \n",
      "decided to move his family out of the city . Like any other parent he wanted his children \n",
      "to go to better schools and mi x with better companions. Fo r his own personal reasons \n",

      "would soon marry, one of the houses would be for him. One of the houses was for the \n",

      "and then we’ll pass you for county inspection.” He took out a red p aper label. “We stamp \n",

      "bastinadoed by the bodyguards. Then he made them put the furnace together again and \n",
      "tidy up the basement. He searched them and f ound that they actually were employed by \n",
      "a house-improvement firm with h eadquarters in Suffolk County. He learned the name of \n",

      "It was typical of the young Santino, before he became older and crueler, that he \n",

      "thinner and this improved her figure. She wa s still voluptuous but more in the American \n",

      "receptionist and had nothing to do with Fr eddie though when he saw her he would stop \n",

      "It was after six months that Tom Hagen came out to see how she was doing. She had \n",

      "legally in every way and her money every mont h would be assured. If the authorities or \n",
      "any law-enforcement agencies ever questioned her , she was to simply refer them to her \n",
      "lawyer and she would not  be bothered any further. \n",
      "Lucy agreed. She understood what was happening but had no objections to how she \n",
      "was being used. It seemed a reasonable favor.  But when Hagen asked her to keep her \n",
      "eyes open around the hotel, keep an eye on  Freddie and on Freddie’s boss, the man \n",
      "who owned and operated the hotel, as a major st ockholder, she said to him, “Oh, Tom, \n",

      "Hagen smiled. “His father worries about Freddi e. He’s in fast co mpany with Moe Greene \n",
      "and we just want to make sure he doesn’t get into any trouble.” He didn’t bother to \n",
      "explain to her that the Don had backed the bui lding of this hotel in the desert of Las \n",

      "It was shortly after this interview that Dr . Jules Segal came to work as the hotel \n",

      "be a doctor, at least to Lucy. She met hi m when a lump grew above her wrist on her \n",
      "forearm. She worried about it for a few days, then one morning went to the doctor’s suite \n",

      "helped and his quiet reserved manner, but t he impression he gave was an informal one, \n",
      "and like many basically old-fashioned people, Lucy didn’t believe that medicine and \n",
      "informality mixed. \n",
      "When she finally got into his office there wa s something so reassuring in his manner \n",
      "that all her misgivings fled. He spoke hardly at all and yet he was not brus que, and he \n",
      "took his time. When she asked him what the lu mp was he patiently ex plained that it was   “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \n",

      "She smiled at him. “Fine,” she said. “You’re pretty unorthodox but you’re pretty good.” \n",
      "He grinned at her. “You don’t know how unor thodox I am. And I didn’t know how rich \n",
      "you were. The Vegas Sun just published the list of point owners in the hotel and Lucy \n",
      "Mancini has a big ten point s. I could have made a fortune on that little bump.” \n",
      "She didn’t answer him, suddenly reminded of  Hagen’s warnings. He grinned again. \n",

      "How about seeing one of the shows with me t onight and I’ll buy you dinner. I’ll even buy \n",

      "She was a little doubtful. He urged her. Finally she said, “I’d like to come but I’m afraid \n",

      "weekends he drove a souped-up MG in the California races.  When he took a vacation \n",
      "he went down into the interior of Mexico , the real wild country, he told her, where \n",
      "strangers were murdered for their shoes and life was as primitive as a thousand years \n",
      "ago. Quite accidentally she learned that  he was a surgeon and had been connected with \n",
      "a famous hospital in New York. \n",
      "All this made her more pooled than ever at his having taken the job at the hotel. When \n",
      "she asked him about it, Jules said, “You tell me  your dark secret and I’ll tell you mine. \n",

      "Now, sitting at the side of the pool with Ju les’ blond head in her lap, she felt an \n",

      "sensuously stroked the skin of his neck. He  seemed to be sleeping, not noticing, and \n",
      "she became excited just by the feel of hi m against her. Suddenly he raised his head \n",
      "from her lap and stood up. He took her by t he hand and led her over the grass on to the \n",

      "After the blazing sun and her own sensuous  thoughts the drink went to her head and \n",
      "made her dizzy. Then Jules had his arms around her and their bodies, naked except for \n",
      "scanty bathing suits, were pressed against each other. Lucy was murmuring. “Don’t,” \n",
      "but there was no conviction in her voice and Jules paid no attention to her. He quickly \n",

      "When he rolled off her body, Lucy huddled into one corner of the bed and began to cry. \n",

      "and say, “You poor benighted Eye-talian girl, so  that’s why you kept refusing me all \n",

      "you are positively medieval.” But the voic e was soothingly comforting as she continued \n",
      "to weep. \n",
      "Jules lit a cigarette and put it  in her mouth so that she c hoked on the smoke and had to \n",
      "stop crying. “Now listen to me,” he said, “i f you had had a decent modern raising with a \n",

      "Hagen shook his head. Freddie had greeted him much less affectionately than Michael, \n",
      "but Hagen understood. Freddie was on his father’s shit list and Freddie naturally blamed \n",
      "the Consigliere for not straightening things  out. Hagen would gladly have done so, but \n",
      "he didn’t know why Freddie was in his father’s  bad graces. The Don did not give voice to \n",

      "Michael, “A good job. It’s knitted nicely. Is the sinus OK?” \n",
      "“Fine,” Michael said. “Thanks for helping out.” \n",
      "Dinner focused on Michael as they ate. They all noted his resemblance in speech and \n",
      "manner to the Don. In some curious way he  inspired the same respect, the same awe, \n",
      "and yet he was perfectly natural, at pains to put everyone at their ease. Hagen as usual \n",
      "remained in the background. The new man they did not know; Albert Neri was also very \n",
      "quiet and unobtrusive. He had claimed he was not hungry and sat in an armchair close \n",
      "to the door reading a local newspaper. \n",
      "After they had had a few drinks and food, the wa iters were dismissed. Michael spoke to \n",
      "Johnny Fontane. “Hear your voice is back as good as ever, you got all your old fans \n",
      "back. Congratulations.” \n",
      "“Thanks,” Johnny said. He was curious about exactly why Michael wanted to see him. \n",
      "What favor would he be asked? \n",
      "Michael addressed them all in  general. “The Corleone Fam ily is thinking of moving out \n",

      "Freddie’s moon face was anxious. “Mike, you sure about Moe Greene selling? He never \n",
      "mentioned it to me and he loves the busi ness. I really don’t think he’ll sell.” \n",
      "Michael said quietly, “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.” \n",
      "The words were said in an ordinary voice, yet the effect was chilling, perhaps because it \n",
      "was a favorite phrase of the Don’s. Michael turned to Johnny Fontane. “The Don is \n",
      "counting on you to help us get started. It ’s been explained to us that entertainment will \n",
      "be the big factor in drawing gamblers. We  hope you’ll sign a contract to appear five \n",

      "the same. You’ve done t hem a lot of favors, now you can call them in.” \n",
      "“Sure,” Johnny said. “I’ll do anything for my Godfather, you know that, Mike.” But there \n",
      "was just the faint shadow of doubt in his voice. \n",
      "Michael smiled and said, “You won’t lose  money on the deal and neither will your \n",

      "enough, they get some points too. Maybe y ou don’t believe me, so let me say I’m \n",
      "speaking the Don’s words.” \n",
      "Johnny said hurriedly, “I believe you, Mike . But there’s ten more hotels and casinos \n",

      "may be too late with all that competition already there.” \n",
      "Tom Hagen spoke up. “The Corleone Family has friends who are financing three of \n",

      "owned the three hotels, with their casinos. And that ther e would be plenty of points to \n",

      "“I’ll start working on it,” Johnny said. \n",

      "because of that old abortion business. I have to know from you, is that what you want?” \n",

      "assume you would do for me what you’d do for any good friend. That’s my string. But \n",

      "Michael nodded and said, “Fine. Until the hospital gets bu ilt and opens up you’ll be \n",
